# Java-Based-DNA-Transcription-Translation

Takes a nucleotide sequences and returns the mRNA, Complementary strand, reading frame and amino acid sequence.
Program mimics the cell's transcription and Translation process.

Only legal inputs are "G", "C", "A" and "T".

If no start codon is found, then the reading frame sequencing is aborted.
Reading frame will also return "N/A" if no stop codon is located. 

There is an option at the end of the program to sequence the mRNA from the beginning of the sequence,
disregarding the prescence (if it exists) of the start and stop codons.
